My final project repository for RCES.

Research Question:
What areas are of greatest concern for heat-related illness in the United States currently and by the end of the century?

Datasets:
NOAA NCEP-NCAR CDAS-1 1981-2010 Climatology
CMIP5 GFDL CM3 model, August 2090-2099, RCP-85 scenario

Project Description:
To identify areas with the greatest risk of heat-related illness, I will visualize current heat-index values and wet-bulb temperatures for the United States. These measurements of heat-stress can be calculated using current (1981-2010) and projected (2090-2099) monthly average surface air temperature and relative humidity values. A total of eight figueres will be produced, with the current and projected heat-index and wet-bulb temperature maps being compared to identify areas of concern.
