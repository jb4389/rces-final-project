# rces-final-project
My final project repository for RCES.

Research Question:
What are the primary sources of air pollution among counties in New York City with the greatest number of days with a high heat index in 2017?

Datasets:
EPA 2017 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) Data
NOAA Daily Temperature and Relative Humidity Data

Project Description:
To calculate the number of days with a high heat index (or above), I will use daily tmperature and relative humidity data (NOAA) for each county to identify and count the number of days with a high heat index. Using the number of days with a high heat index for each county, I will identify the two counties with the greatest number of days with a high heat index. For each of these counties, I will calculate the total contribution of each source of air pollution identified in the NEA Data, and identify the three primary sources of pollution.
